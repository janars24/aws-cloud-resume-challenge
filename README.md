# 🚀 I Completed the Cloud Resume Challenge (AWS)!

I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed the **Cloud Resume Challenge**, a hands-on, full-stack cloud project originally designed by [Forrest Brazeal](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/). This project allowed me to go beyond certifications and build a real-world, production-ready cloud application — end to end!

## 🛠️ Key Highlights

✅ **Frontend:**
- Deployed a responsive resume website using **HTML** and **CSS**
- Hosted the static site using **Amazon S3**
- Enabled secure traffic through **CloudFront (HTTPS)** and a **custom domain via Route 53**

✅ **Visitor Counter:**
- Implemented a dynamic visitor count using:
  - **JavaScript** for the frontend
  - **AWS Lambda** with **Python (boto3)** for the backend logic
  - **Amazon DynamoDB** for persistent counter storage
  - **Function URL (fURL)** for direct invocation

✅ **CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Automated frontend deployment using **GitHub Actions**
- Source code versioned and managed via **GitHub Repos**
